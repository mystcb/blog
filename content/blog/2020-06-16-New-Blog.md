So I have finally decided to have another go at creating a website. Decided to start using Hugo again as my CMS static site generator, mainly due to cost, but also to speed up the delivery of the site.

I have used Hugo as part of the static website for [Tokonatsu](https://www.tokonatsu.org.uk), a Japanese Culture and Camping Festival based in Helow, Bedforshire, UK. It has proven to be pretty reliable, so why not use it for my on website!
