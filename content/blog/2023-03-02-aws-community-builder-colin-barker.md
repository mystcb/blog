Not a long post, just one for me to say that I am thrilled to have been accepted as an AWS Community Builder! It had been on my list for a while, but need a bit more confidence to really apply! I have been accepted on the **Networking and Content Delivery** category.

To find out more about the program head over to the [AWS Community Builders](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/) site!

Small shout out to my fellow [AWS SMEs](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-sme-program/) for encouraging me to apply, and especially [Jimmy Dahlqvist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dahlqvistjimmy/) for being an awesome mentor through this process!
